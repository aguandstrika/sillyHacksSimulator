# sillyHacksSimulator
sillyhacks Project
We are Team.sillyTwo making a game for the sillyhacks 48-hour hackathon. Our game is a wacky 3D hackathon simulator adventure game. You have 24-hour aka 24 minutes to build skills, meet new people and survive the hackathon.  

Inspiration
We were inspired by the simulator games of our day, some that are serious and some that are silly!

What it does
It offers you a chance to experience a hackathon without having to be in a hackathon. Time to get stressed and get silly!. You play as a hacker at the live Silly Hacks Hackathon. Walk around and check out some of the sponsors!. Take a look at what your other hackers are doing! You have full control over the character and can choose to take the opportunities to attend workshops, take a nap, or get a snack! But make sure you keep on eye on that timer! If your project isn't at least 75% done then you don't have an MVP! Let your energy run low and you will not make it till the end! Time to feel the stress of participating in a live hackathon!
